  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Verdana size=3>The picture on the casting
  rules is pretty bad for users used to XPath 1.0. Users have to learn a lot of
  fairly complex casting rules, need to keep track of the types of values as
  they write code, and need to add code to check the castability of values. A
  few &quot;gotchas&quot; have been introduced, where the same expressions
  silently work differently than they used to. On the plus side, dropping the
  first-item semantics from XPath means that there's less potential for
  confusion when using the reverse axes.</font><br>
