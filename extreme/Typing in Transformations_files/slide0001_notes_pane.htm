  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Verdana size=3>This talk is about how the
  type-related changes introduced in XPath 2.0 will affect XSLT users. The talk
  doesn't say anything about XQuery, because there isn't an existing user base
  of XQuery users who are going to be surprised by the changes. I personally
  believe that resolving the usability problems encountered by XSLT users will
  also help XQuery users, but it's clear that they are different communities
  with different expectations from the respective languages.</font><br>
