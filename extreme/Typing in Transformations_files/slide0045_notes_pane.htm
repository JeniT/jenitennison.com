  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Verdana size=3>These slides answer the
  original question: &quot;Do I have to learn all this type-related stuff to
  use XSLT 2.0?&quot; The answer is &quot;Yes&quot;. Authors have to learn the
  type system (though they can concentrate on the 12 or so useful types). They
  also have to learn the casting rules: which types can be cast to which others
  (which is not straight-forward); how values are cast between the types (which
  is not straight-forward); and how untyped values get cast in different
  circumstances, (which is not straight-forward, particularly when using
  polymorphic operators). Authors might also want to learn how to declare the
  types of variables and parameters.</font><br>
