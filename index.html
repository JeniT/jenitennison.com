    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      I am an expert in all things data, from technology, to governance, strategy, and public policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am the founder and Executive Director of <a href="https://connectedbydata.org/">Connected by data</a>, an initiative that aims to put community at the heart of data narratives, practices and policies. Through that initiative, I challenge the language of data ownership and question the role of individual consent, arguing that when data is processed in aggregate, it should be governed collectively. I undertakes this work as a <a href="https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/fellows/">Shuttleworth Foundation Fellow</a> and an Associated Researcher at the <a href="https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/">Bennett Institute for Public Policy</a>, examining the practice and public policy behind data governance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also the co-chair of the <a href="https://gpai.ai/projects/data-governance/">Data Governance Working Group</a> at the <a href="https://gpai.ai/">Global Partnership on AI</a>, which is carrying out applied research to explore data trusts, data justice and technologies that enhance privacy, justice or rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was CEO at the <a href="https://theodi.org/">Open Data Institute</a>, where I held leadership roles for nine years and worked with companies and governments to build an open, trustworthy data ecosystem. Before joining ODI, I worked as an independent consultant, specialising in open data publishing and consumption. I was the technical architect and lead developer behind <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/">legislation.gov.uk</a> and worked on the initial development of <a href="https://data.gov.uk/">data.gov.uk</a>. I have a long-standing interest in open and web standards, served on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/">W3C's Technical Architecture Group</a> and co-chaired the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/05/lcsv-charter.html">W3Câ€™s CSV on the Web Working Group</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sit on the Boards of <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>, the <a href="https://www.data4sdgs.org/">Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data</a> and the <a href="https://ials.sas.ac.uk/research/areas-research/information-law-and-policy">Information Law and Policy Centre</a>. I have a PhD in AI and an OBE for services to technology and open data. I love Lego and board games and am the proud co-creator of the open data board game, <a href="https://theodi.org/service/tools-resources/datopolis/">Datopolis</a>.
