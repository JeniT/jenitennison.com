    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      I am an expert in all things data, from technology, to governance, strategy, and public policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in leadership roles, including being CEO, at the <a href="https://www.theodi.org/">Open Data Institute</a> for nine years. There, I developed and directed the ODI’s approach to topics such as open data, data governance, data portability and data institutions, as well as leading research, development and advisory work in sectors ranging from health and climate to agriculture and engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before joining ODI, I worked as an independent consultant, specialising in open data publishing and consumption. I was the technical architect and lead developer behind <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/">legislation.gov.uk</a> and worked on the initial development of <a href="http://data.gov.uk/">data.gov.uk</a>. I have a long-standing interest in open and web standards, served on the W3C's Technical Architecture Group and co-chaired the W3C’s CSV on the Web Working Group.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am the co-chair of the <a href="https://gpai.ai/projects/data-governance/">Data Governance Working Group</a> within the <a href="https://gpai.ai/">Global Partnership for AI</a>, and sit on the Boards of <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>, the <a href="https://www.data4sdgs.org/">Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data</a> and the <a href="https://ials.sas.ac.uk/research/areas-research/information-law-and-policy">Information Law and Policy Centre</a>. I have a PhD in AI and an OBE for services to technology and open data. I love Lego and board games and am the proud co-creator of the open data board game, <a href="https://theodi.org/service/tools-resources/datopolis/">Datopolis</a>.
