      <h1>Unit Testing XSLT</h1>
      <div>
         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>This is a package that makes it easy to write and run unit tests for
      XSLT code. All you need is to unzip the .zip file <a href="unit-testing.zip">unit-testing.zip</a> somewhere and install <a href="http://saxon.sf.net/">Saxon 8.4B</a> (or later), with
      <code>saxon8.jar</code> in your <code>CLASSPATH</code>.</p>
         <div class="note">
            <p>I've made various upgrades to the testing package since August. 
      These changes are reflected in the text below.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="note">
            <p>My apologies to Linux and Mac users: I would supply shell files for
        running the unit tests, but I don't know how to write them. Any kindly
        soul who wishes to donate is more than welcome: it should all be
        portable, since it's just Java and XSLT. Actually, I'm no expert at
        writing Windows batch files either, so if anyone wants to smarten up
        <code>test.bat</code> they're more than welcome.</p>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div>
         <h2>Writing the Tests</h2>
         <p>I've tried to design this package to make writing tests easy. That
      means avoiding having to write anything that could be created
      automatically, such as test IDs (although you can supply them), calls to
      the tested functions or templates or comparison code. You write the tests
      inside your stylesheet, just before the code that you want to test.</p>
         <div class="example">
            <div class="title">Simple Example</div>
            <p>This is a really simple example of a single test that checks the
        result of calling the <code>eg:square()</code> function with the
        <code>number</code> parameter set to <code>2</code>. The
        expected result is the number <code>4</code>.</p>
            <pre>&lt;test:tests&gt;
  &lt;test:test&gt;
    &lt;test:param name="number" select="2" /&gt;
    &lt;test:expect select="4" /&gt;
  &lt;/test:test&gt;
&lt;/test:tests&gt;
&lt;xsl:function name="eg:square" as="xs:double"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:param name="number" as="xs:double" /&gt;
  &lt;xsl:sequence select="$number * $number" /&gt;
&lt;/xsl:function&gt;</pre>
         </div>
         <p>All the testing elements are in the namespace
      <code>http://www.jenitennison.com/xslt/unit-test</code>, so you need
      to declare that in your stylesheet and you probably want to prevent
      namespace declarations for that namespace littering your code, so you need
      to use the <code>exclude-result-prefixes</code> attribute on
      <code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet&gt;</code> as follows:</p>
         <pre>&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="..."
                xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
                ...
                xmlns:test="http://www.jenitennison.com/xslt/unit-test"
                exclude-result-prefixes="... test"&gt;
...
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;</pre>
         <p>The tests that are applicable to a particular template or function are
      all wrapped in a <code>&lt;test:tests&gt;</code> element. This is
      primarily to make it easy to collapse them all out of the way (in editors
      that can do such a thing) so they don't become too distracting when
      writing the code. Individual tests are given in
      <code>&lt;test:test&gt;</code> elements.</p>
         <p>Both <code>&lt;test:tests&gt;</code> and
      <code>&lt;test:test&gt;</code> elements can have an
      <code>id</code> attribute to specify a unique identifier and/or a
      <code>&lt;test:title&gt;</code> child that gives a human-readable
      title. Both are optional.</p>
         <p>Within the <code>&lt;test:test&gt;</code> element, you need to
      specify the input to the template or function and the expected output. The
      input can consist of a context node (for templates only) specified with an
      optional <code>&lt;test:context&gt;</code> element and any number of
      parameters specified with <code>&lt;test:param&gt;</code> elements.
      The expected output must be specified with a
      <code>&lt;test:expect&gt;</code> element.</p>
         <p>The values for the context, parameters and expected result are all
      defined in the same ways. For atomic values (strings, numbers and the
      like), use the <code>select</code> attribute, as in the example
      previously. If you want to specify nodes, you need to supply a document
      from which the nodes can be selected. You can do this either with the
      <code>href</code> attribute, which gives a URI for an external
      document, or by embedding the document (or document fragment) within the
      relevant element. The <code>select</code> attribute is then used to
      select nodes within the document; the path it holds is interpreted from
      the root/document node of the document. The default value for the 
      <code>select</code> attribute is <code>"/*"</code>, which 
      selects (all) the document element(s).</p>
         <div class="example">
            <div class="title">Testing using external documents</div>
            <p>If you want to test the stylesheet as a whole, the easiest thing to
        do is to create external input/output files and reference them. Note
        that the result must be an XML document, so you can't use this to test
        HTML output.</p>
            <pre>&lt;test:tests&gt;
  &lt;test:test&gt;
    &lt;test:context href="input.xml" /&gt;
    &lt;test:expect href="output.xml" /&gt;
  &lt;/test:test&gt;
&lt;/test:tests&gt;
&lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt;
  ...
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</pre>
         </div>
         <div class="example">
            <div class="title">Supplying nodes as context and expected value</div>
            <p>You can test with simplified documents by simply embedding the
        important part within the test itself. The embedded document should
        include any important ancestors of the relevant element, but doesn't
        need to include any of the irrelevant parts of the document. Use the
        <code>select</code> attribute to pick the nodes you want from the
        document. Remember that if your function or template returns something
        other than elements, you will need a <code>select</code>
        attribute on the <code>&lt;test:expect&gt;</code> element too.</p>
            <pre>&lt;test:tests&gt;
  &lt;test:test&gt;
    &lt;test:title&gt;Empty header cells&lt;/test:title&gt;
    &lt;test:context select="/table/tgroup/thead/row/entry"&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tgroup&gt;
          &lt;thead&gt;
            &lt;row&gt;
              &lt;entry /&gt;
            &lt;/row&gt;
          &lt;/thead&gt;
        &lt;/tgroup&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/test:context&gt;
    &lt;test:expect&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&amp;#x160;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/test:expect&gt;
  &lt;/test:test&gt;
&lt;/test:tests&gt;    
&lt;xsl:template match="thead/row/entry"&gt;
  ...
  &lt;xsl:when test="not(*) and not(normalize-space(.))"&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;&amp;#x160;&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:when&gt;
  ...
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</pre>
         </div>
         <div class="note">Differences in whitespace-only text nodes between the expected and 
      actual result are ignored in this version. If you want to generate tests
      that take whitespace-only text nodes into account, you'll need to 
      configure the testing; see below.</div>
      </div>
      <div>
         <h2>Running the Tests</h2>
         <p>Quick version: change directory to the directory where you unzipped
      anything and run <code>test.bat</code> with the stylesheet you want
      to test as the only argument. The command line looks like:</p>
         <pre>test <var>stylesheet.xsl</var>
         </pre>
         <p>Long version: there are three steps, the last one optional, and of
      course you can reuse the results of any one of them.</p>
         <ol>
            <li>
               <p>Process your stylesheet with
          <code>generate-tests.xsl</code>. The result is a stylesheet
          that contains the code for the tests. You can put this wherever you
          want; <code>test.bat</code> puts it in the same directory as the
          original stylesheet, and calls it
          <code>test-<var>stylesheet</var>.xsl</code>.
          Generating the stylesheet shouldn't produce any errors, unless you've
          written a test wrong or <code>generate-tests.xsl</code> still
          contains bugs. I'm afraid that there's not much error-checking code in
          <code>generate-tests.xsl</code> at the moment, so either could
          result in errors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Run the generated stylesheet using anything you like as the source
          document, or by invoking the <code>main</code> template
          directly. This runs the unit tests themselves. The result is an XML
          document holding a report on what tests were run and their results;
          <code>test.bat</code> puts it in the same directory again as the
          original stylesheet, and calls it
          <code>test-<var>stylesheet</var>-result.xml</code>.
        </p>
               <p>You may get errors at this stage, associated with supplying
          invalid values for parameters for example. If the stylesheet fails any
          of the tests, you'll get a message telling you the ID and title of the
          test. The ID may be gibberish if you haven't supplied any IDs or
          titles, so this is a good reason to include them. If you don't get any
          errors or messages, then you know everything's gone smoothly.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Finally, particularly if there were failed tests that you can't
          trace, you can format the XML report using
          <code>format-report.xsl</code>. This produces a nice HTML page
          (well, an HTML page) from the XML report; <code>test.bat</code>
          puts it in the same directory as the original stylesheet, and calls it
          <code>test-<var>stylesheet</var>-result.html</code>.
          You shouldn't get any errors at this stage, but it's always possible.
          Open up the HTML document and there you have it.</p>
            </li>
         </ol>
         <p>If you want to customize the HTML report that you get, you can edit
      <code>base.css</code> or (of course),
      <code>format-report.xsl</code> to your heart's content.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
         <h2>Standalone Test Suites</h2>
         <p>Wouldn't you know it, while I prefer to have tests embedded in my 
      stylesheet, it turns out other people don't! Well, you can have the best
      of both worlds.</p>
         <p>A standalone test suite has a <code>&lt;test:suite&gt;</code>
      document element. The <code>&lt;test:suite&gt;</code> element has 
      two attributes: <code>stylesheet</code>, which is a URL (relative 
      to the test suite document) that points to the stylesheet tested by the
      suite; and <code>date</code>, which is a <code>xs:dateTime</code>
      that gives the date/time for the suite, useful for versioning.</p>
         <p>The <code>&lt;test:suite&gt;</code> element contains one or 
      more <code>&lt;test:tests&gt;</code> elements, which are the same
      as described above except that they also contain, immediately after the 
      <code>&lt;test:title&gt;</code> element if there is one, a 
      <code>&lt;test:xslt&gt;</code> element. The 
      <code>&lt;test:xslt&gt;</code> element contains either an 
      <code>&lt;xsl:template&gt;</code> or a 
      <code>&lt;xsl:function&gt;</code> element, with 
      <code>name</code>, <code>match</code> and/or 
      <code>mode</code> attributes to identify the template/function 
      being tested but no content.</p>
         <div class="example">
            <div class="title">Standalone Test Suite</div>
            <p>Here's what a standalone test suite for a 
        <code>utils.xsl</code> stylesheet, last modified at 12:44 on
        September 20th 2005, looks like. The only test shown is for the 
        <code>eg:square</code> function.</p>
            <pre>&lt;test:suite stylesheet="utils.xsl"
            date="2005-09-20T12:44:00"&gt;
        
&lt;test:tests&gt;
  &lt;test:xslt&gt;
    &lt;xsl:function name="eg:square" /&gt;
  &lt;/test:xslt&gt;
  &lt;test:test&gt;
    &lt;test:param name="number" select="2" /&gt;
    &lt;test:expect select="4" /&gt;
  &lt;/test:test&gt;
  ...
&lt;/test:tests&gt;
...
&lt;/test:suite&gt;</pre>
         </div>
         <p>You can use a standalone test suite as the argument to 
      <code>test.bat</code> (or input to 
      <code>generate-tests.xsl</code> if you're doing things by hand),
      and the tests will be run on the referenced stylesheet.</p>
         <p>The <code>extract-tests.xsl</code> stylesheet transforms a
      stylesheet that has tests embedded in it into a standalone test suite. I
      haven't done the reverse of that as yet...</p>
      </div>
      <div>
         <h2>Configuring the Testing</h2>
         <p>You can configure the details of how the testing is carried out, and
      in particular how sequences/items/nodes are compared, by creating your
      own implementations of the various functions in 
      <code>generate-tests-utils.xsl</code>. A 
      <code>test:config</code> attribute on the 
      <code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet&gt;</code> element, or a 
      <code>config</code> attribute on the 
      <code>&lt;test:suite&gt;</code> element in a standalone test suite,
      can point to a stylesheet which contains these implementations in order
      to override the default behaviour.</p>
         <div class="example">
            <div class="title">Ignoring Insignificant Ordering Differences</div>
            <p>By default, this testing package compares the expected and actual 
        results on an item-by-item basis. So if you expect</p>
            <pre>&lt;xs:all&gt;
  &lt;xs:element ref="foo" /&gt;
  &lt;xs:element ref="bar" /&gt;
&lt;/xs:all&gt;</pre>
            <p>but you get</p>
            <pre>&lt;xs:all&gt;
  &lt;xs:element ref="bar" /&gt;
  &lt;xs:element ref="foo" /&gt;
&lt;/xs:all&gt;</pre>
            <p>then the test fails.</p>
            <p>In some cases, it might be that you really don't care what order
        particular elements appear in, just as long as they're all generated.
        In this example, the <code>&lt;xs:element&gt;</code> elements 
        appearing in the content of the <code>&lt;xs:all&gt;</code>
        element can appear in any order with the same meaning.</p>
            <p>To configure the testing package to ignore these ordering 
        differences, you can create <code>xsd-config.xsl</code>,
        which overrides the <code>test:sorted-children</code> function
        from <code>generate-test-utils.xsl</code>. This ensures that
        the sequence of <code>&lt;xs:element&gt;</code> elements are
        sorted by name before being compared, effectively ignoring the original
        order in which they appeared.</p>
            <p>To use <code>xsd-config.xsl</code>, include a reference to
        it from the <code>test:config</code> attribute on the 
        <code>&lt;xsl:styelsheet&gt;</code> document element.</p>
            <pre>&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="2.0"
                xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"

                extension-element-prefixes="test"
                test:config="xsd-config.xsl"&gt;

&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;</pre>

      <div>
         <h2>Background</h2>
         <p>I've heard a lot about XP over the last few years, but never really
      got into the whole unit testing thing: I think that like a lot of
      programmers, I viewed writing tests as too much hard work. But during this
      summer (2005), I'm working on a project that's using an XP development
      methodology, plus Tim Bray talked glowingly about XP and unit testing
      during his talk about the XML Summer School. I decided that if I was going
      to do unit testing, I needed it to be really easy to write and run the
      tests.</p>
         <p>So during the remaining couple of days at the XML Summer School, I
      hacked up the solution you see here. I tried to remain true to the rest of
      the XP philosophy: this does the minimum of what I need it to do at the
      moment, and if I find I need it to do more, <em>then</em> I'll
      add the code to do it.</p>
         <p>The way I use it is that I've rigged up &lt;oXygen/&gt; with an
      "External Tool" so that I can hit a button and have the tests run and the
      results come up in the browser. If you use &lt;oXygen/&gt;, it's easy
      enough to do: go to Tools &gt; External Tools &gt; Preferences, click New
      and fill in the form as follows (I have the unit testing files in
      <code>D:\library\unit testing</code>):</p>
         <dl>
            <dt>Name</dt>
            <dd>
               <p>Test Stylesheet</p>
