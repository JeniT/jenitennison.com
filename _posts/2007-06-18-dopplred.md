[Norm Walsh][1] invited me onto [Dopplr][2], and like a fool I joined. Why, oh why, did I bother? I never leave home. All my "fellow travellers" know where I am. And it just makes me jealous knowing they're jetting off to... let's see... Montreal, Sebastapol, San Francisco, Redmond, Barcelona, Amsterdam, Limoges, San Jose, Toulouse, Berlin, Seattle, Monterey, Lahaina, Tokyo, Geneva, Naples, Prague, and so on.

Maybe I'll pretend my immobility is a principled stance against superfluous air travel.
