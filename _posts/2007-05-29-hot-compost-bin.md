We're going to be moving to a new house soon, and one of the first things I intend to do is get a compost bin. We produce an inordinate amount of food waste in our house, at least partly due to two small children who can be quite fussy eaters, so I'm looking for a compost bin that takes cooked food as well as vegetable peelings and the like (ie a digester as well as a composter).

The [Green Johanna][1] looks like it'll do the job perfectly, and actually [benefits from a mix of waste][2] so will take our cardboard too! Plus it comes with a little coat for winter. How sweet. It's on the expensive side, but [Recycle Now][3] shows that there's roughly a 25% discount in my area, plus a whole pound off for shopping online.
