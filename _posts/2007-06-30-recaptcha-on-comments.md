I've installed [reCAPTCHA Drupal module][1] as a way of combating the large amount of comment spam that I get on this blog, and to support the [reCAPTCHA][2] project. What a fantastic idea! I see that there's already a term for using human expertise in a fun or transparent way to solve problems that can't be solved by computers: [bionic software][3].

ReCAPTCHAs are fun and add to human knowledge, but if you want to avoid them (they do take a little time to load) then [create yourself a login][4]. On the other hand, if you have some spare cycles, then you can [do reCAPTCHAs][5] on the reCAPTCHA site without creating lots of comments here.
