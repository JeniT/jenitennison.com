I guess it's an indication of something (like just being indexed by Google) when you first get comment spam on your blog. Anyway, I really don't want to insist that commentators create accounts here, so after several annoying days of repeatedly deleting spam comments, I installed the [Drupal][1] [Spam module][2] and every spam comment since has been captured.

[2]: http://drupal.org/project/spam "Spam module"

Of course it hasn't been tested for false positives yet, so send those comments flying in and see if you can trip the Bayesian filters.

You might notice that I've also reconfigured the feed so that you get the full post rather than just the teaser if you're reading via an aggregator. I hope that's more convenient.
