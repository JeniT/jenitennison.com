One: [My article][1] in the [Women in Technology][2] series came out about a month ago. It was actually inspired by [this comment][3] on the post I wrote a while ago on women in computing, which asked about encouraging your daughters to take up computing. I found it easier to write about that than my own experiences, which have been rather mundane.

Two: Read [OMG Girlz Don't Exist on teh Intarweb!!!!][4]. It'd be hilarious if it weren't so dreadful.

Three: We've been looking at possible infant (ages 4-7) schools for our eldest. The two nearest both have interactive whiteboards in all the classrooms and regular IT lessons. In one school, the children are taught how to touch type; this at an age when they can hardly read and write. When I was in school, touch typing was on typewriters, for the girls who aspired to be secretaries. (I [Mavis Beacon][5]'d myself during my year out of university; it's the most frequently used skill I have next to the ability to read.)
