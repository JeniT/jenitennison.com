[XTech 2007][1] is less than a month away! I'm going to be presenting on [Creole: Validating Overlapping Markup][2] in the Core Technologies track on Wednesday 16th May at 16:00. Yes, I know it's really an [Extreme][3] paper, but (a) I'm not going to Extreme this year, (b) I'll be reaching out to a slightly wider audience, and (c) I just cannot wait any longer to talk about [Creole][4]!

The only trouble is: how am I going to make overlapping markup interesting to all the Web 2.0 geeks? More to the point: how do I explain the elegance of Brzozowski derivatives without losing at least half the audience?
