My dad got me a [FLY pentop computer][1] for my birthday! Basically, it lets you draw your own interface on special paper: draw a box, some numbers, some operators and an equals sign, and you've got a calculator; draw a keyboard and some circles for drums, and you can make music; write details of an appointment, and it'll store it and repeat it at the designated time.

Yes, I knew that they were aimed at 8-13 year olds and I'm... hrm... a couple of years (well, let's be honest, decades) outside that age bracket, but I don't think either of us realised quite what "aimed at 8-13 year olds" would actually mean.

It comes with special stickers that will make the pen make a farting noise.

Enough said.

The most annoying thing? The technology is **so cool**! It does handwriting recognition (albeit only capital case), and can recognise and repeat something like 70,000 words. That's just with the built-in firmware. And it has a moderate amount of built-in memory. The recharging dock comes with a USB socket. Wouldn't you think that they'd release some kind of developer's kit for the budding 8-13 year old hackers? Or that someone, somewhere, somehow, had managed to hack it anyway?

Ah well, at least I can rest assured that it will make me popular (for about 15 minutes) with fellow geeks... and any 8-13 year olds I happen to come across.
