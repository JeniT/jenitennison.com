It's XTech 2008 next week. I'll be there to talk about the work we  at [TSO][1] have been doing with [OPSI][2] to add semantic information to the [London Gazette][3] using RDFa. It's really interesting and timely work on all sorts of levels; you can [read the abstract of the talk][4] to get a taster and of course it'll be published afterwards.

Anyway, I was just browsing through the schedule and it struck me how few women they were speaking. Looking at the [speaker list][5], out of the 64 speakers, just **three** are women. Three! That's not even 5%!

Looking back at last year, it was a little better, at nine out of 94, which is getting towards 10%. It wasn't much better at XML 2007, where nine of the 82 speakers (11%) were female. At Extreme 2007, eight of the 60 speakers (13%) were women.

I wonder whether there are a low proportion of women attending these conferences generally, or whether women attend in higher proportions but don't submit papers, or whether they submit papers but a smaller proportion are accepted.

Anyway, if you're a woman who's going to XTech 2008 and you want to get together to [talk about kittens][6], drop me a line.
