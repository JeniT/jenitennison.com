I [posted before](http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/107) about the joys of the [XML Summer School](http://www.xmlsummerschool.com/): the learning, the punting, the drinking! Now the [Semantic Technologies](http://xmlsummerschool.com/curriculum2009/semantic-technologies/) track has been fleshed out to include:

  * Bob DuCharme giving an overview on the semantic web
  * Leigh Dodds talking about publishing linked data
  * Andy Seabourne talking about SPARQL
  * Duncan Hall talking about creating ontologies

It's not really XML, I suppose, but it's certainly a bunch of interesting and timely topics. I particularly hope that we'll get some public sector people in the room so that we can discuss some of the challenges and opportunities in that area.
