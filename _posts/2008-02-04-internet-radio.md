When my dad introduced me to his internet radios, I thought, "wow, there's something for everyone!" So I went looking for something for *me*. And yesterday I found it: [Kink ClassX][1]. It plays "alternative" music from the 60s to the present day. I listened to Bowie, Marilyn Manson, Arethra Franklin, Squeeze, Souxie, Otis Redding, the White Stripes: a really diverse set of music, with one thing in common -- All Good.

OK, so you have to sit through german-language new bulletins every hour on the hour, but to me that just adds to the charm.
