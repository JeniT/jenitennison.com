I haven't been posting here very much of late because my XML-related posts (which tends to be most of them) have been going on [xml.com][1]. When I joined xml.com, the promise was more exposure with a wider audience. Then they changed the blogging system, and changed it again, and by now I'm not sure if there's any audience at all!

However O'Reilly have, finally, provided author-based Atom feeds. So if you want to subscribe to my future xml.com posts, the crucial URL is [feed://broadcast.oreilly.com/jeni-tennison/atom.xml][2]. If you want to see my previous posts, they can be found under the "blog" tab on my [author page][3].
