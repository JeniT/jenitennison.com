If you're anywhere near Oxford on the weekend of the 11-12th July, and are interested in parsing, querying and manipulating RDF(a) in a browser, come along to the [rdfQuery](http://code.google.com/p/rdfquery) Dazzle (hack days). The [official page](http://swig.networkedplanet.com/dazzle.html) lists some of the things we might work on:

  * Applications: widgets, adding to existing RDFa sites
  * Core development: documentation, packaging, microformats, named graphs, and ontologies
  * Interfaces: Talis change markup, N3 and Turtle, and SPARQL

It's free to attend, you can come for either or both days, and refreshments, entertainment and wifi will be provided, so [register now](http://rdfquery.eventbrite.com/)!
