[The Stationery Office][1], where I've been working as a contractor for the last two years, is looking (rather desperately) for two "content developers" to work in Norwich in a permanent capacity for around Â£38-42k.

They seem to be advertising through agencies, so it's hard to tell exactly which job adverts are theirs, but I think they might be these ones for a [XML/XSLT Content Developer][3] and a [XML Content Developer][4].

From what I gather, the two roles both require core XML skills, including XSLT and XML Schema, but on top of that TSO are looking in particular for:

  * someone who is familiar with XML databases, XQuery, and the delivery of web-based applications based on XML
  * someone who is familiar with the semantic web, RDF, RDFa, ontologies, SPARQL and so on

I find the work challenging and interesting, and particularly enjoy the fact that most of the content we deal with is public-sector information. If you want to know more, feel free to email me, or send your CV to [Paul Appleby][2] and mention that you heard about the job here.
